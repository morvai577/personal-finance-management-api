# personal-finance-management-api
The Personal Finance Management (PFM) API is designed to help users better manage their personal finances by offering features such as expense tracking, budgeting, income tracking, and financial reporting.

## Here's a breakdown of the key components and functionalities in this API:

- [ ] Authentication and User Management: Implement a secure authentication system, such as OAuth 2.0, to ensure only authorized users can access the API. Additionally, include endpoints for user registration, profile management, and password recovery.

- [ ] Transaction Management: Allow users to add, edit, and delete transactions (expenses, incomes, and transfers). Transactions should include details like amount, date, description, category, and payment method. You can also include features to import transactions from bank accounts or other sources using APIs or file uploads (CSV, OFX, etc.).

- [ ] Categories and Tags: Create a flexible categorization system that allows users to organize their transactions into categories and subcategories. Also, consider adding a tagging feature for more granular organization.

- [ ] Budgeting: Allow users to set budgets for specific categories or periods (e.g., monthly, quarterly). Users should be able to track their spending and compare it to their budget limits. Implement notifications to alert users when they approach or exceed their budget.

- [ ] Savings Goals: Provide a feature for users to set savings goals, such as buying a car or saving for a vacation. Track the progress towards these goals based on the user's income and spending habits.

- [ ] Reporting and Analytics: Implement various reports and visualizations to help users analyze their financial data, such as income vs. expenses, spending by category, and transaction trends over time. Offer customizable date ranges and filters for these reports.

- [ ] Currency Conversion: If your API supports multiple currencies, include a currency conversion feature that uses up-to-date exchange rates. This feature can be helpful for users who travel frequently or have accounts in different currencies.

- [ ] Notifications and Reminders: Create a notification system that sends users reminders about upcoming bills or alerts them to unusual transactions, like large expenses or low account balances.

- [ ] API Documentation: Provide clear and comprehensive documentation for your API, including descriptions of all available endpoints, request/response formats, and authentication requirements. This will help other developers understand how to interact with your API effectively.

- [ ] Security and Performance: Ensure that your API is secure by following best practices like using HTTPS, implementing rate limiting, and validating user input. Additionally, optimize performance by caching frequently accessed data and using efficient algorithms.
